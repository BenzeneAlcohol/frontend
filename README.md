##HTML CSS Project

Used flexbox to do this project. I had a picture of the website I had to make, and I made one almost similar to it. There are a few issues with the image color and resposiveness of the website ![desktop-design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75667393/115362462-2d04cb80-a1df-11eb-9602-3d65b89001e7.jpg)

This is the design that I wanted to create
